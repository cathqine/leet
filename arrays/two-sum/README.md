# Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] == target` and `i != j`.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

### Time complexity
You should aim for a solution with `O(n)` time and `O(n)` space, where n is the size of the input array.

### Example 1:
```js
Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
```
### Example 2:
```js
Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

Output: [0,2]
```
### Example 3:
```js
Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10

Output: [0,1]
```
