# Valid Anagram
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

### Example 1
Input: `s = "racecar"`, `t = "carrace"`

Output: `true`

### Example 2
Input: `s = "jar"`, `t = "jam"`

Output: `false`
